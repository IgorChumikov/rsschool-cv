Rane tried programming in Java, 1C, but unfortunately it did not work. Then I met courses on YouTube Vyacheslav Bely, The Swift Developers. These courses impressed me a lot. IOS is what I want to do, I understood for myself. I havenâ€™t written a single application, but I like to see the result of my efforts, the way the code works. I really like to read podcasts, new features. I like to think about the problems I solve, even if they are educational tasks. First of all, I expect emotional satisfaction from the profession of a programmer, I really want to work in one of the large software development companies
